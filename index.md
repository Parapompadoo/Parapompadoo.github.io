# Tanay Agrawal

I am a fourth year staudent at BITS Pilani, Pilani campus, India pursuing a dual degree course in B.E.(Hons) Electronics and Instrumentation and M.Sc.(Hons) Mathematics. I'm passionate about solving problems using computers, data and mathematics.

My broad research interests lie in computer vision and reinforcement learning, particularly, in developing computer vision systems for videos (action recognition, segmentation, etc.) and applying reinforcement learning to make the processes more human like. In the past, this has included research on action recognition using reinforcement learning for traversing the video and object counting in videos.

I am currently working under Dr. Devesh Samaiya at BITS Pilani on Foreground segmentation in HEVC encoded videos.

Refer to my CV (link above) for more details.
